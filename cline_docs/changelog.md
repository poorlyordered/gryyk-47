# Changelog: Strategic Workflow & EVE API Integration

This document summarizes the development work completed, focusing on the implementation of the core strategic workflow and the integration of live EVE Online API data.

## 1. Core Strategic Workflow Implementation

We have successfully implemented the end-to-end strategic workflow, enabling the AI to analyze corporation data and assist with updating the Strategic Matrix.

### Key Features:

- **Session State Management**:
  - Enhanced the `chat` Zustand store (`src/store/chat.ts`) to manage the lifecycle of a strategic session (`idle`, `loading_context`, `analyzing`, `recommending`, `updating_matrix`).

- **New UI Components**:
  - `StrategicSessionManager.tsx`: A control panel for users to initiate a new strategic session and monitor its current state.
  - `UpdateProposal.tsx`: A user interface for reviewing, accepting, or rejecting AI-suggested updates to Strategic Matrix documents.

- **Backend API for Workflows**:
  - Created a new Netlify serverless function (`strategic-workflows.ts`) to orchestrate the strategic session, from fetching context to managing AI interaction.
  - Refactored existing serverless functions to use a shared `auth-middleware.ts`, improving code consistency and security.

- **AI-Powered Document Updates**:
  - **Prompt Engineering**: The AI is now instructed to propose changes to Strategic Matrix documents in a structured JSON format when a user agrees to an update.
  - **Response Parsing**: The frontend can parse these JSON proposals from the AI's responses, presenting them to the user for one-click confirmation.
  - **Update Execution**: Accepted proposals are seamlessly applied to the database via the existing Strategic Matrix update service.

## 2. EVE Online API Integration

We have integrated live EVE Online data into the strategic analysis process, significantly enriching the context provided to the AI.

### Key Features:

- **Secure EVE API Proxy**:
  - Created a new Netlify serverless function (`eve-api-proxy.ts`) that acts as a secure backend proxy for all requests to the EVE ESI, protecting user access tokens.

- **Dedicated Frontend Service**:
  - Developed a new, typed service (`src/services/esi.ts`) for making clean and maintainable calls to the EVE API proxy from the frontend.

- **Enriched AI Context**:
  - The `strategic-workflows` backend now fetches both static documents from the MongoDB `strategic-matrix` and live data from the EVE API in parallel.
  - The initial AI analysis prompt is now dynamically enriched with live data (starting with corporation info), allowing the AI to perform a more accurate and timely analysis by comparing user-curated documents against on-chain facts.

## Overall Impact

This work completes the implementation of the core strategic workflow outlined in the project plan. The system is now capable of initiating a strategic session, loading a rich context of both static and live data, performing an AI-driven analysis, and facilitating updates to the Strategic Matrix based on that analysis. This marks a major milestone for the Gryyk-47 project.
