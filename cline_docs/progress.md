Enables direct, type-safe access to EVE Online data and operations for Gryyk-47's vertical slices and agent-based features. Highly suitable for AI agent workflows by topic (e.g., assets, corp info, market, fleet, etc.).
- **2025-04-12**: Fixed EVE SSO "Invalid state parameter" error with secure state parameter handling.
- **2025-04-12**: Created and documented MongoDB data model implementation plan for persistent chat and LLM context.
- **2025-04-13**: Noted evaluation of Google's Agent Development Kit, agent2agent protocol, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for orchestrating multi-agent, multi-system workflows. Potential for advanced agent-based features, distributed reasoning, and cross-system collaboration in Gryyk-47. [See: https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/build-and-manage-multi-system-agents-with-vertex-ai]
- **2025-04-12**: Installed Vercel AI SDK for advanced LLM orchestration.
