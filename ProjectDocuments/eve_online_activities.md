Unexpected Detail: Alpha Clone Restrictions
An interesting aspect is the Alpha clone restrictions, noted in EVE University Wiki, such as no ice mining or PI, which affect activity availability for your Alpha characters. This wasn’t directly requested but is relevant for your corporation’s operations, especially given your earlier mention of Alpha pilots.

Recommendations and Considerations
For Get Alpha'ed, consider focusing on activities like missions, mining (ore, not ice for Alphas), and joining corporations to build your base, leveraging Nolan’s experience. The diverse list ensures members can find roles, from combat to economy, aligning with your AI-guided empire vision. Verify ice resources in Hentogaira in-game, as noted in previous discussions, to confirm industrial viability.
